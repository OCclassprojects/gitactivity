Here are the **instructions**!

2. Fork the repository to your Github account
3. Clone the repository with Git on your computer
4. Use ***git log*** to look at the file structure and commits.  Note how many commits, trees, and blobs there are!
5. Create a new branch and checkout (you can name the branch what you want)
6. Use git log to look at your new branch
7. Create a new file called test.txt
8. Write *“Github is awesome!”* in your file and save it.
9. Add and commit your new file to your branch
10. Now run a ***git fetch*** to see if any new files are on the main repo
11. Use ***git merge*** to merge your branch to the master branch on your local repo
12. Get on the **master branch** as your working directory
13. Use *git interactive rebase* to change move the 2nd commit to a spot after the 4th commit
14. Change the commit message to *“moved commit”*
15. Use *git interactive rebase* to *squash* the 2nd, 3rd and 4th commit into one.
16. Change the commit message to *“squashed 2,3,4”*
17. Use ***git reflog*** to look at your work
18. Bonus: type in ***gitk --all*** and screenshot the GUI graph of your repository and commit it to your branch
19. Bonus: use the command ***git log --graph --full-history --all*** and screenshot that and commit it to your branch
20.  Push your branch to the remote repository and create a Pull Request!
